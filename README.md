# Callout Integrator for Obsidian

This is a simple plugin to allow for easier integration of long blocks of text into callouts by inserting ">" at each line break within a highlighted block of text. 

## Installation and Setup
Download the latest release and navigate to the .obsidian file. Choose the vault in which you would like to install the plugin, and copy the files to the **plugins** folder. Then, navigate to **Community Plugins** tab in settings and turn the switch next to **Callout Integrator for Obsidian** to *on*. Then, navigate to the hotkeys tab to define a keyboard shortcut for the action. Alternatively, you can activate the plugin by typing *Callout Integrator* into the command palette.

## Known Issues
There have been issues with the plugin not working on blocks of text that begin with an empty line. I have been unable to reproduce the error since, so please let me know if the issue persists.
